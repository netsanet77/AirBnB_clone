AirBnB clone - The console
The goal of the projects is to deploy on your serever a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
Command interpreter is exactly the same with shell but limited to a specific use-case. I use it to:
create a new object
retrieve an object from a file, a database...
do operations on objects
update attributes of an object
destroy an object
